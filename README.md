# Iris-Flower-Classification-Model
# This project was a part of CodSoft internship in which I have to perform 3 task out of which one was Iris Flower Classification. In this project we have to build Machine Learning model which will help us to classify different types of Iris species when different feature are entered in the model for prediction.
